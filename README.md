# PNN
Learning Poisson Systems and Trajectories of Autonomous Systems via Poisson Neural Networks  
learner: https://github.com/jpzxshi/learner  
Environment: python=3.12.9 numpy=2.3.1 torch=2.6.0+cu126  

Correction:  
The expression for \tau in APPENDIX D-C (Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation) of PNN paper is incorrect.  
The correct form should be: \tau(x)=\sqrt{\frac{\exp{x}-1}{x}}.
